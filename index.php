                Initially, the cards holding the images of the robots will be 
                empty, and it is your job to match the robots that look alike. 
                Each successful match will award you with <strong>five</strong> 
                points. You must match all the robots to progress to the next 
                level before you run out of <strong>lives</strong>.

                You heard that right, there are a limited number of lives to add some pressure
                on you! The game has <strong>five</strong> levels in total, 
                and the first level has <strong>twenty</strong> cards. Each level 
                gets more challenging as <strong>six</strong> additional cards are 
                introduced. You can quit the game whenever you wish to do so.

                You can play the game as a guest, but the perks of being a
                registered user is that your score will automatically be entered
                into the <strong>leaderboard</strong>. This way, you will know 
                where you stand among other players who have played Memorybot 
                in the past and also compete against your friends.
